# automate
Bash script automation example.

Written in vim.

Instructions:
git clone then change directory `cd automate` and run the script `./taskAutomator.sh`

Make sure to have your git account configured:

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

Will then see usual (yet irregular) activity on your GitHub account for as long as the script runs.
